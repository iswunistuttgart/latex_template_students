\chapter{Introduction}

The aim of student theses is to show that students are able to work on tasks from their own field independently and according to scientific methods and that they can present their results appropriately. 
These objectives, defined in the examination regulations, raise a number of questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item What does ``working according to scientific methods'' actually mean?
\item What belongs to the proper presentation of results?
\item Which standards and guidelines apply at the \ac{ISW}?
\item What is to be considered in general when writing student theses at the \ac{ISW}?
\end{itemize}

Read the guidelines for the preparation of student theses at \ac{ISW}! The chapters used in this template are for inspiration only. Each thesis is different and the chapter headings and their order should be adapted accordingly.
